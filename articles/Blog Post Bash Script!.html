        <h2>Blog Post Bash Script!</h2>
        <p>I wrote a Bash script that uploads blog posts for me. I used awk which, to be honest, I don't know that well. It's really surprising how much you can do with so few lines of code... and other people's programs as well (lol).</p>
        <p>I think I might make a similar script for my projects page. That's going to need much more complicated templates though. Oh well. We'll get there.</p>
        <p>tldr: All you need is bash.</p>
        <p>Thanks for reading.</p>
