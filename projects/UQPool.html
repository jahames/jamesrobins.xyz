        <h2>A semester of learning and pain</h2>
        <p>I spent the majority of my semester working on a carpooling app. This was
            for my capstone course, DECO3801. Myself and a team of 5 other Computer Science
            and Information Technology students, known as Team Wilson Love (after our
            blind team member's guide dog), built a React-Native app with a NodeJS Express
            backend.
        </p>
        <p>I volunteered myself to be the team leader, so beyond being a full stack developer 
            on this project, I also had to manage the team and be a project manager. The experience
            has taught me a lot. Technology-wise, I know feel confident in saying that I now understand
            Javascript, ReactJS and React-Native, NodeJS with ExpressJS, Google APIs, RESTful APIs
            and SocketIO communication a lot better. As the team leader, I also learnt a lot of harsh lessons 
            about project management. Kanban wasn't enough to manage this project, and in the future
            I hope to learn some better ways to keep track of development.
        </p>
        <p>On future projects I also wish to set up CICD pipelines with automatic cloud deployment. 
            Dealing with Git merge-hell is not a fun experience, especially with inexperienced devs like
            those on this project. Azure won't give me a free trial though, and AWS has a terrible UI... I
            might have to go with GCP. GCP has the smallest market share though, so there's an argument against
            it there. I've been using smaller cloud providers for my projects, I might set up a Gitea or Gitlab 
            instance with Jenkins. I'd be a qualified Devops engineer then.

        </p>
        <p>As the team leader I also took on the responsibilities of presenting our app at a course 
            tradeshow and at a mid-project evaluation. I also took charge of producing any videos, 
            like the promotional video seen below. Overall it was a very good experience, and I got to do a lot of cool things.

        </p>
        <p>I'd like to thank my team members also. I learnt a lot from Nathan Hettige and am really grateful
            for all his hardwork throughout the semester. I'd like to thank my old friends from highschool, Bob Melham
            and Reggie Bladen. Bob took on a lot of the more theoretical aspects of this project, such as 
            pairing riders and drivers. I'd like to thank Reggie as well, he tried his best throughout the semester
            and seriously improved. I'd also like to thank Yuma Decaux, a blind engineer, for being an inspiration
            and life mentor. Thanks to Yujun Li as well for being a part of the team, and doing the important design work.
            Thanks to everyone in the team for putting up with my inexperience with managing software projects, in the future
            it's all going to go swimmingly. I swear.
