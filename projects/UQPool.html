        <h2>A semester of learning and pain</h2>
        <p>I spent the majority of my semester working on a carpooling app. This was
            for my capstone course, DECO3801. Myself and a team of 5 other Computer Science
            and Information Technology students, known as Team Wilson Love (after our
            blind team member's guide dog), built a React-Native app with a NodeJS Express
            backend.
        </p>
        <p>I volunteered myself to be the team leader, so beyond being a full stack developer 
            on this project, I also had to manage the team and be a project manager. The experience
            has taught me a lot. Technology-wise, I know feel confident in saying that I now understand
            Javascript, ReactJS and React-Native, NodeJS with ExpressJS, Google APIs, RESTful APIs
            and SocketIO communication a lot better. As the team leader, I also learnt a lot of harsh lessons 
            about project management. Kanban wasn't enough to manage this project, and in the future
            I hope to learn some better ways to keep track of development.
        </p>
        <p>On future projects I also wish to set up CICD pipelines with automatic cloud deployment. 
            Dealing with Git merge-hell is not a fun experience, especially with inexperienced devs like
            those on this project. 
        </p>
        <p>As the team leader I also took on the responsibilities of presenting our app at an Expo and
            at a mid-project evaluation. I also took charge of producing any videos, like the Kickstarter
            seen above. Overall it was a very good experience, and I got to do a lot of cool things.
